            <h1>OVERVIEW</h1>
            <p>Legit is a fashion store in Africa, it is one of the biggest brands in 
                women’s fashion here in South Africa especially. Legit only sells clothes and
                 accessories for women, and more specifically for young women. These stores can

            <p>The Legit store website project was a solo/practise project started with the objective of challenging myself to build a professional website. 
                The idea came about when I was attempting to browse the Legit winter catalogue and found that obtaining specific information is very difficult.</p>
                <p>The user interface of the Legit website had very basic functionality and features with almost no helpful information with regard to the clothing sold in their stores. 
                    The timeline for the project was 1 month, with the majority of the work being done in this time. 
                    A few enhancements were completed outside the set period.</p>

    <h1>UX DESIGN PROCESS</h1>
    <h2>RESEARCH METHOD</h2>
    <p>To conduct my research, I made use of a quantitative method. I sent the Link to the actual Legit Fashion
         Store website to a sample group of females. The Link was shared via Whatsapp and the responses captured either via messages
          or voice notes on the app. The research was conducted with one objective, to get a reading on how user friendly the website was. 
    </p>
    <p>Further research was conducted by reading through the comments left on the Legit Store’s Instagram and Facebook pages and posts.</p>

      <p>I chose this method of collecting data because it was quick, I did not

      <p>I learnt that using a larger more diverse sample group can be beneficial to 
          obtain a more accurate representation of everyone’s experience on the website. 
          The use of larger platforms such as Facebook and Twitter would be in other research if required.

<div class="problem" id="issue">
    <h1>DEFINING THE PROBLEM</h1>
    <p>Legit’s website does not resemble an e-commerce website, It seems its only purpose is to direct users to their social media pages. It does not seem as though
         any planning was done on the website; the placement of elements on the page seems ‘random’. The logo is barely visible, the store finder is barely visible, icons blend in with the background.

        The store finder link works well, this is how I was able to find out that they have stores in Botswana and Namibia. The button for scrolling up works really well, 
        however, there is not much content to scroll up to. There is little to no content on the website. The website seems redundant in my opinion.</p>
</div>
<div class="problem" id="solution">
    <h1>COMING UP WITH SOLUTION</h1>
    <p>In an attempt to try and solve this problem, I decided to try and redesign the user interface of the website. I went and looked at different e-commerce websites for inspiration, 
        the one that I drew the most inspiration from is the Mr. Price website.</p>
        <h1>TEST SOLUTION AND ITERATION</h1>
        <p>So far, I have only worked on two iterations of the website; below are the wireframes and the images of what my first iterations looked like. </p>
        <h1>WIREFRAMES</h1>

    </div>
    <div class="testing" id="test">
        <h1>TESTING</h1>
        <p>While working on the prototypes,I did ask my research group for feedback on how they feel about my iteration. I also asked for advice from an acquaintance who happens to be studying product design,
             and is very knowledgeable in that field.
             I also shared both of my figma iteration files with him.

            I downloaded the mobile Figma app to test and see how the website would look and work on a real Android phone, this is something that I did not do when I was creating 
            my first iteration and my design had a lot of functionality issues. In my first iteration I added a hover effect animation on the different categories, 
            and I later realised that that particular design decision did not make sense, because one cannot hover on a smartphone, we can only touch.</p>

    <div class="next">
        <h1>NEXT STEP AND LEARNING</h1>
        <p>One thing that I have learnt through working on this project and especially working on this case study, is that research is a very vital part when it comes to ux/ui design; and not only before you work on a project, but even during design. I have also learnt that it is important to sketch and take notes of everything that you are doing before during and after design.

            Next, I will be working to improve this website, I am still not completely satisfied with how it looks like at the moment, but I will kee</p>
